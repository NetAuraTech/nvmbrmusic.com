 * alongside the `backup/` folder used by the backup system. The active disk
 * is resolved from `DRIVE_DISK` in the environment — the same variable the
 * drive config uses for its default disk — and must match one of the keys
 * declared in `config/drive.ts` (`fs`, `s3`, or `r2`).
 *
 * This service is intentionally thin — it delegates all actual I/O to
 * AdonisJS Drive and only adds env-based disk resolution and silent-delete
